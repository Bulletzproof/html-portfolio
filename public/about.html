<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Graduated from American Culture and Literature department of Ankara University, I first started my career
  as an English teacher. Finding out that it was the most boring job ever, I quit then entered advertising.
  Nowadays I realized how shitty it is as well so I'm trying to learn programming.
