<h1>My Favorite Movies</h1>
<h2>My Favorite Movies but in H2</h2>
<hr />
<H3>Cruella</H3>
<p>So this is not really my favorite but it's the latest one I remember. 
It was great. Liked the whole villain thing. It being a Disney movie also adds up to the atmosphere I guess.</p>
<h3>Doctor Strange</h3>
<p>Because it had Scarlet witch in it.</p>
<h3>Silent Place 2</h3>
<p>Because it was cool!</p>
